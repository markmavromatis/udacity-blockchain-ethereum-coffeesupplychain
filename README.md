# Supply chain & data auditing

This repository containts an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a Supply Chain flow between a Seller and Buyer. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. A Seller can add items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. A Buyer can purchase such items from the inventory system. Additionally a Seller can mark an item as Shipped, and similarly a Buyer can mark an item as Received.

The DApp User Interface when running should look like...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

```
Give examples (to be clarified)
```

### Installing

> The starter code is written for **Solidity v0.4.24**. At the time of writing, the current Truffle v5 comes with Solidity v0.5 that requires function *mutability* and *visibility* to be specified (please refer to Solidity [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/050-breaking-changes.html) for more details). To use this starter code, please run `npm i -g truffle@4.1.14` to install Truffle v4 with Solidity v0.4.24. 

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd1309/tree/master/course-5/project-6
```

Change directory to ```project-6``` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in ```package.json```):

```
cd project-6
npm install
```

Launch Ganache:

```
ganache-cli -m "spirit supply whale amount human item harsh scare congress discover talent hamster"
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/ganache-cli.png)

In a separate terminal window, Compile smart contracts:

```
truffle compile
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/truffle_compile.png)

This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder ```build\contracts```.

Migrate smart contracts to the locally running blockchain, ganache-cli:

```
truffle migrate
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/truffle_migrate.png)

Test smart contracts:

```
truffle test
```

All 10 tests should pass.

![truffle test](images/truffle_test.png)

In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:

```
npm run dev
```

## Project Notes

This project implements a coffee beans supply chain project built as a decentralized app on the ethereum blockchain. It tracks the lifecycle of a harvested coffee bean from the farm to the consumer's shopping bag using a smart contract!

1. As the coffee bean is harvested, a farmer registers the bean on the blockchain with the source farm details.
2. The farmer marks the bean as "processed"
3. The farmer packs the bean in preparation for shipping to a distributor.
4. The farmer marks the bean for sale
5. A distributor buys the bean.
6. The farmer ships the bean to the associated retailer.
7. A consumer purchases the bean.

### Deployment notes

This contract has been deployed to the Goerli ethereum testnet blockchain.

- Contract creation transaction hash: 0xbc00bb642e1e86876f2458c5c83861b1a73622448f27f425cc6524242e71cf13
- Contract address: 0xc187ccbE0D6D2e99E2ef6B1f888843574FF79De3

### Additional libraries

My project code adds two node modules:
- truffle-assertions: Detects events while running smart contract unit tests.
- truffle-hdwallet-provider: Integrates Truffle with Goerli testnet network
